            <h5>Hi, I'm Ashley!</h5>
            <p>
                I’ve recently discovered a passion for programming, and I really enjoy the thrill of solving complex problems. When I’m not coding, I love to unwind with music, whether I’m dancing to upbeat amapiano or getting lost in soul music. I also have a keen interest in basketball, whether I’m playing with my friends or cheering for my favorite teams. Balancing these interests brings a lot of joy to my life and keeps me inspired to explore new ideas and challenges!
